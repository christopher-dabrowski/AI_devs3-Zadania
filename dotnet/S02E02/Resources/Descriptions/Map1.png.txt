To analyze the map image for identifying the specific city, consider the following notable features:

1. **Street Names:**
   - Kalinkowa
   - Brzeźna
   - Chełmińska
   - Chopina

2. **Road Patterns and Infrastructure:**
   - Chełmińska appears to be a major road, possibly an arterial route.
   - The map shows a linear arrangement with right-angle intersections mainly along Chełmińska.
   - Chopina appears as a smaller, possibly more residential street, intersecting Chełmińska.

3. **Urban Layout and Density:**
   - The layout suggests a mix of residential and possibly commercial areas along the main roads.
   - There seems to be an organized grid pattern adjacent to the major road.

4. **Notable Features:**
   - The map features icons at certain locations, indicating possible landmarks or significant points of interest.
   - The labels "NM" on these icons could denote important sites, such as monuments or markers.

5. **Spatial Relationships:**
   - Chełmińska serves as a central axis, suggesting a focal point or main thoroughfare for movement within this area.

These features suggest a city with structured urban planning, possibly in Poland, given the street names. Identifying the city would require cross-referencing these street names and characteristics with a larger database or map.
